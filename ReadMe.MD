Volatitily - Linux Like PSTree output plugin. 

The linux command, PSTree gives a very easy way to see the process hierarchy. 

The PSTree/PSlist plugins in Volatility are great but they dont make it super easy to see the process hierachy quickly. 


v1.3.6 --- First basic parser complete. 

Next update -- Import Volatility and parse the logs into the format used here. 
            -- Fix the ouput becuase the 3rd layer of sub process are not aligned Parent. Will change sorting.
